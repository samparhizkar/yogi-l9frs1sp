and make them automatically documented and visually discoverable.

### Components

Yogi comes with 40+ components to get started: menu, dialog, buttons, checkbox, cards, everything to cover the basics, and more.

## Usage

### Getting Started in Backlight (recommended)

This is the recommended way, as Backlight gives you an all-in-one design system platform.

In order to create your own project from this starter kit using Backlight, go to the [Backlight website](https://backlight.dev/) and sign up or log in if you already have an account. Make sure you have a workspace, then go to the [Backlight starter-kits list](https://backlight.dev/starter-kits) and click the **Yogi** card, this will create a project based on this starter kit for you.

### Duplicate in Backlight

Make sure you have a Backlight Workspace, then go to [`yogi-starter` on backlight](https://backlight.dev/edit/sNbJipmRTmslL3f8RZaO/) and click the **Duplicate** button in the top right corner to fork it.

## Documentation

### Design System Documentation

_Yogi_ is shipped with a good documentation basis which starts in the [introduction](https://backlight.dev/doc/sNbJipmRTmslL3f8RZaO/introduction/doc/index.mdx) and then walks you through the usage of tokens and components. Just open it and start exploring!

### Backlight Documentation

We created [DS Mastery](https://backlight.dev/mastery/) to help you become a hero in the design system development.

To learn about Backlight features there is an [official documentation](https://backlight.dev/docs/) too.
